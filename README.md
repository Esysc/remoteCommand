## remoteCommand

The perl language has been employed because of multi-platform support needs.

The clients running it are Linux, Windows and Aix.

The data is grabbed from a remote database via a restful Api.

The remote database can be interrogate to check if remote commands have been
allocated to the host. If it's the case, the command is downloaded from the database, arguments if any as well,
and then executed.
